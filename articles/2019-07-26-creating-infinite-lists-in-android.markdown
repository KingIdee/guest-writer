**TL;DR:** In the third part of these series, you will learn how to create infinite lists with the Android Paging Library. You can find the final code developed throughout the article in this GitHub repository.


## Prerequisites

Since this is the third part of a series, it is recommended that you have completed the first two parts of the series, however, if you have not done so, you can still jump on this. It is still expected that you possess some prior understanding of Android development. The prerequisites from the [first part](https://auth0.com/blog/android-tutorial-building-and-securing-your-first-app-part-1/#Prerequisites) still stand also.
